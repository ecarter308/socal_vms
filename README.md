AIS and VMS Processing Steps for Southern California
11/22/2024 – Eliza Carter


### VMS
- Data received from OLE
- Cleaned raw data files so they would be correctly read as CSVs into R
- Some lines were not reading geometry correctly
- Renamed cleaned files as “NOAAA_24_006_year_month_clean”
- Combined the three csvs for each month into one (00 vms combine)
- Clean up land data (01 land data cleaning)
- Contains files for continents, big islands, small islands, very small islands, 1 mile buffered ports, 1 mile buffered harbors
- Clip points to the SoCal polygon (02 vms point clip to polygon)
- Clip points to only land, filter for points <= 4 for fishing speeds, and export points for each month (03 vms ocean fishing)
- Merge all month point files into a single year using Arc tools
- Reconstruct Tracks in ArcPro for each year
- Use a distance of 4 international nautical miles and 90 minutes to split lines
- Merge all track years into one file using Arc tools
- Use Isaac’s script to count the number of intersections for each declaration code per BOEM aliquot grid cell per year (vms rasterize lines)
- Project grid and VMS lines to UTM Zone 11N for the west coast
- Count vessel transits per cell (end points inside and end points on the edges of each cell divided by 2)
- Make a count field for each declaration code for the unique vessel doc numbers per cell (ex. Average # vessels per year per declaration code = 269, unique vessels per declaration code = doc_269)
- Export to a shapefile
- Ran Isaac’s script on the shapefile with all transits and divided by 9 for a yearly average

### AIS
- Download AIS tracks that Brian created for all west coast EEZ
- Select all AIS lines at intersect the study area/grid (01 Combine Intersecting AIS Features.py)
- Use the [Vessel Type Codes (2018)](https://coast.noaa.gov/data/marinecadastre/ais/VesselTypeCodes2018.pdf) file to classify the AIS codes into ship types in Isaac’s processing script
- Use Isaac’s script to count the number of intersections for each vessel type per BOEM aliquot grid cell per year (02 ais lines count)
- Project grid and VMS lines to UTM Zone 11N for the west coast
- Count vessel transits per cell (end points inside and end points on the edges of each cell divided by 2)
- Export to a shapefile
- Create summary files for ORI AOA by using only lines that intersect the AOA
